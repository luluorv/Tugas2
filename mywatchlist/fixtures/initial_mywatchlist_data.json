Although it's being treated as a horror film - Which is not a problem unless you generalize this as the overall genre for this movie - Its more of a Suspense Thriller/Drama/Horror. This is not something I feel needs to be clarified, but understood as the film envelops all three entities."

The plot leaves much to be desired, with a generic 'Fight the Powah' theme that's better suited with Gurren Lagann (and I'm not just saying that because Galo looks like Kamina, despite Studio Trigger claiming the looks are coincidental). Major events were predictable, particularly with the climax."

I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags; in fact it is far from it, instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film."
